The repo includes a bunch of files, some of which we ourselves forgot what they do. You'll have to make sense of everything, I guess. However, at the very least:
- The `backend/algorithm` folder should include the final solution.
- The `backend/attemps` has all the attempts we could find on Radu Bratan's computer.
- The `backend/api-original` folder should contain a copy of the original API which should be run locally in order for the solution to be tested.
- The `backend/api-top10` is a modified version of the API which somehow doesn't work any more but, if I remember correctly, was used during the classification of all the submissions. The only difference that I remeber between it and the original is that it contains the second set of CSV files, offerred to all teams for the purpose of the final scoring. Other differences could also be present. The second set of CSV files can also be found in `eval-data-main.zip`.
